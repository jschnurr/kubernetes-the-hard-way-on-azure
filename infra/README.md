# Install shell script execution platform

## - Choose the running platform
For Windows, there are 3 options:
1. Command Prompt (cmd)
2. Or, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)* on Windows 10: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10  
3. Or, WSL2* on Windows 10: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install  
*choose Ubuntu 18.04 LTS distro either way

For Linux, there are 2 options:
1. Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS (Bionic Beaver): https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/  
2. Or, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa): https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/

## Instructions for Command Prompt on Windows:

### - Change directory to home in command prompt
```
cd %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%
```

### - Install Git in command prompt
* Install Git for Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win

### - Clean kthw-azure-git directory, if already exists
```
rd %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\kthw-azure-git /S
```

### - Clone git repo into kthw-azure git directory
```
git clone https://github.com/ankursoni/kubernetes-the-hard-way-on-azure.git %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\kthw-azure-git
```

### - Install docker in command prompt:
* Install Docker for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install  

### - Build docker image with the image name as kthw-azure-image
```
cd %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\kthw-azure-git\infra
docker build -t kthw-azure-image .
```

### - Run docker container in interactive terminal with kthw-azure-git directory mounted from the host machine
```
docker run -it --name=kthw-azure-container --mount type=bind,source=%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\kthw-azure-git,target=/root/kthw-azure-git kthw-azure-image bash

# if the above command fails with the error 'Unhandled exception: Drive has not been shared' then you need to share your windows home drive (most likely c:) with docker inside docker Settings > Resources > File Sharing
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59942110/docker-drive-has-not-been-shared

# replace the line ending from \r\n to just \n in all the script files
# this action is needed because the git clone operation happened on command prompt and windows puts \r\n for line endings while linux understands \n for line endings
cd ~/kthw-azure-git/scripts
sed -i 's/\r$//g' *.sh

# to logout from container
exit
```

### - Resume the docker container in interactive terminal
```
# start the containeras it may be in stopped state because of logout
docker start kthw-azure-container

# attach to the current running process - bash in the started container
docker attach kthw-azure-container
```
**Note** - here onwards for next instructions and commands, always run inside docker container using the steps mentioned above

>All done with prerequisites on command prompt, now head to section - [Provision infrastructure on cloud](#provision-infrastructure-on-cloud)

# Provision infrastructure on cloud

## - Set the values for the variables by writing to the var file - azurerm-secret.tfvars
```
cd ~

az login
az account list
# note the id as <SUBSCRIPTION_ID> and tenantId as <TENANT_ID> from the output of previous command

# generate an azure service principal with contributor permissions, if you don't already have one:
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
# note the appId as <CLIENT_ID> and password as <CLIENT_SECRET> from the output of previous command

# generate an ssh key, if you don't already have one:
ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -C <EMAIL_ADDRESS>
# note the path of the file "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" as <SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE>

# copy the template variable file
cd ~/kthw-azure-git/infra

sed -i 's|<WORKER_VM_COUNT>|VALUE|g' azurerm-secret.tfvars


# verify the auzurerm-secret.tfvars file by displaying its content
cat azurerm-secret.tfvars

# output should be something like this

## - Deploy infrastructure
```
cd ~/kthw-azure-git/infra

# initialise terraform providers
terraform init

# execute infrastructure provisioning command
terraform apply -var-file=azurerm-secret.tfvars

# if terraform throws any error, it may be due to dns name conflicts with already deployed infrastructure in the chosen azure location.
